# stylua-nvim

stylua-nvim is a minimal wrapper around the Lua code formatter,
[StyLua](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua). It does pretty much what
you'd expect it to do, format your Lua file using Stylua.

### Install
Make sure you have StyLua installed and then install this plugin:

```lua
use({"ckipp01/stylua-nvim"})
```

### Docs

Everything you need should be in the [help
docs](https://github.com/ckipp01/stylua-nvim/blob/master/doc/stylua-nvim.txt).
